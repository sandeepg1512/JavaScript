Are Higher Order functions and Call back functions the same ? If not,
briefly explain about both functions.

They are not the same. Passed function is called callback function. Where as the function  where we are passing the callback function a higher order function.

Eg- function add(a, b, handle){ // handle is callback function 
    let result = a + b;
    handle(result);
}

function sendRequest(result){
    console.log("Sending data to server ", result);
}

add(4, 5, sendRequest); // add is higher order function
