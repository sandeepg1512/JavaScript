# JavaScript Assignments
These are the assignments for the Blockchain course.

# JS-Assignment-01
1. Write a program to find whether a given year is a leap year or not.

2. Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit. ( Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9, where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit) Expected Output : 60°C is 140 °F, 45°F is 7.222222222222222°C

3. Write a program to find the factorial of a number.

# JS-Assignment-02
1. Write a Javascript function to check whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

2. Write a function using switch case to find the grade of a student based on marks obtained a. “S grade” if the marks are between 90 and 100. b. “A grade” if the marks are between 80 and 90. c. “B grade” if the marks are between 70 and 80. d. “C grade” if the marks are between 60 and 70. e. “D grade” if the marks are between 50 and 60. f. “E grade” if the marks are between 40 and 50. g. “Student has failed” if the marks are between 0 and 40. h. Else output “Invalid marks”.

3. Write a JavaScript program to find the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000

4. Write a program to find the factorial of all prime numbers between a given range. Range will be passed as 2 values in the function parameters. eg- if it is needed to find the values for numbers 1-100, then function declaration can look like - function prime(1,100).

# JS-Assignment-03
1. Using for loops, write a Javascript program to output the following pattern - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

2. Write a program to find whether a given number is armstrong number or not. The Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers. Let's try to understand why 153 is an Armstrong number. 153 = (111)+(555)+(333) where: (111)=1 (555)=125 (333)=27 So: 1+125+27=153

3. Write a program to find whether a given number is special number or not. If the sum of the factorial of digits of a number (N) is equal to the number itself, the number (N) is called a special number. eg- 145 is a special number Logic- 1! + 4! + 5!= 1+24+120 i.e 145
