# JavaScript Assignments
These are the assignments for the Blockchain course.

# JS-Assignment-01
1. Write a program to find whether a given year is a leap year or not.

2. Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit. ( Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9, where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit) Expected Output : 60°C is 140 °F, 45°F is 7.222222222222222°C

3. Write a program to find the factorial of a number.

# JS-Assignment-02
1. Write a Javascript function to check whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

2. Write a function using switch case to find the grade of a student based on marks obtained a. “S grade” if the marks are between 90 and 100. b. “A grade” if the marks are between 80 and 90. c. “B grade” if the marks are between 70 and 80. d. “C grade” if the marks are between 60 and 70. e. “D grade” if the marks are between 50 and 60. f. “E grade” if the marks are between 40 and 50. g. “Student has failed” if the marks are between 0 and 40. h. Else output “Invalid marks”.

3. Write a JavaScript program to find the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000

4. Write a program to find the factorial of all prime numbers between a given range. Range will be passed as 2 values in the function parameters. eg- if it is needed to find the values for numbers 1-100, then function declaration can look like - function prime(1,100).

# JS-Assignment-03
1. Using for loops, write a Javascript program to output the following pattern - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

2. Write a program to find whether a given number is armstrong number or not. The Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers. Let's try to understand why 153 is an Armstrong number. 153 = (111)+(555)+(333) where: (111)=1 (555)=125 (333)=27 So: 1+125+27=153

3. Write a program to find whether a given number is special number or not. If the sum of the factorial of digits of a number (N) is equal to the number itself, the number (N) is called a special number. eg- 145 is a special number Logic- 1! + 4! + 5!= 1+24+120 i.e 145

# JS-Assignment-04
This assignment will help you interpret mathematical relationships both algebraically and geometrically. Refer the Link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mEBvdrL_pJvI8o-OsbRWSJevVbAhZrOf/view . Create a function that takes a number (step) as an argument and returns the number of matchsticks in that step. See step 1, 2 and 3 in the image above. Take input from the user in the function parameter and return the output using the return statement.

examples- matchHouses(1) ➞ 6 matchHouses(4) ➞ 21 matchHouses(87) ➞ 436

# JS-Assignment-05
Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a Cylinder, Sphere and Cone with four decimal places using objects and classes. Create classes for volumes for each geometric shape which returns the output using the getVolume() method.
eg- to get volume of cylinder- let obj= new Cylinder(radius,height); obj.getVolume();

Formulas for volumes of the shapes-

1. Cylinder- Volume = πr^2h where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.

2. Sphere- Volume= 4/3πr^3 where r is the radius

3. Cone- Volume= πr^2h/3 where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone.

# JS-Assignment-06
1. Perform the following operations to provide the implementation for a Rectangle class. The operations are: i. Add an area() method to the Rectangle class. ii. Create a Square class that satisfies the following conditions: ○ It is a subclass of Rectangle. ○ It contains a constructor and no other methods. ○ It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.

2. Write a javascript function find_largest to return the nth largest number in an array. eg- given an array of integers - [3,45,6,7,23,5,7,8]. find_largest(3) will return third largest number from the above array which is 8.

3. Write a JavaScript program which accept a number as input in the function parameter and insert dashes (-) between each two even numbers. For example if you accept 025468 as the output should be 0-254-6-8. computeDash(025468) -> 0-254-6-8.

# JS-Assignment-07
1. Input a String S, and check its length and if the length is greater than 4, truncate the input String and output the result -
Input: Ice              Output: Ice
Input: Icecream         Output: Icec...

2. Input a String S with multiple words, and remove whitespaces and output the result -
Input: “Hii Boy”    Output: “HiiBoy”

3. Input a String S with two words, and replace first word with second word and display the result -
Input: “Hii Boy” Output: “Boy Hii”

4. Input a String S with a word, and replace character “a” with “x” and display the result -
Input: “apple” Output: “xpple”

5. What string method can be used to convert string into array?

6. What string method can be used to check the occurrence of a specified text in a string?

7. How can you break a string to a newline in Javascript?

8. Write a Javascript function to test whether the first character of a string is lowercase.

8. Give a correct verdict to users input if he enters "yes", "YES","Yes" etc (any combination) using string methods. How will you handle that ?

10. Given a String S, achieve following tasks a) Convert the String into upper case. b) Convert only the first character to uppercase. c) Convert the String into lower case. d) Break the string into two halves and swap them. e) Count the repeating characters. f) Reverse the string
